# Chapter II – REVIEW OF RELATED STUDIES AND SYSTEM

## Technical Background

The development of the Lumber Management System rests upon the integration of robust and scalable web technologies designed to meet the specific needs of small to medium enterprises. Central to this project is the utilization of a web-based architecture, which allows for centralized data management while providing flexible access across multiple devices. This approach is supported by the client-server model, where the application logic and database reside on a host computer (server), while users interact with the system through web browsers on their respective workstations (clients). This configuration is particularly advantageous for local businesses as it minimizes the need for high-end hardware on every employee's desk, relying instead on the processing power of the central server (Tanenbaum & Wetherall, 2021).

For the backend framework, the system employs Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is renowned for its "batteries-included" philosophy, providing built-in features for authentication, content administration, and database management out of the box. This choice significantly reduces development time and ensures a secure foundation, protecting the application against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (Django Software Foundation, 2023). By leveraging Python's extensive library ecosystem, the system can efficiently handle complex calculations like board-feet volume conversions and generate automated PDF reports.

On the frontend, the system utilizes a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a responsive and intuitive user interface. Specifically, the Tailwind CSS framework is adopted to ensure a modern, utility-first design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktop monitors to tablets. This responsiveness is critical for the operational environment of a lumberyard, where staff may need to access inventory data while moving around the facility. Complementing this is the use of Alpine.js, a lightweight JavaScript framework that adds interactivity to the user interface without the bloat of larger frontend libraries. This ensures that the application remains fast and lightweight, performing well even on hardware with modest specifications (Modern Web Development Standards, 2022).

Data management is handled through a relational database system, which is essential for maintaining the structured records of inventory, sales, and supplier data. The relationship between data entities—such as products belonging to categories or sales orders linked to specific customers—is enforced strictly to ensure data integrity. This structured approach allows for complex queries and report generation, enabling business owners to extract meaningful insights from their raw operational data. The use of an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) within Django further abstracts the database interactions, allowing developers to manipulate database records using Python code rather than raw SQL, which enhances code maintainability and readability (Database Systems Journal, 2021).

## Hardware Specification

To ensure the optimal performance of the Lumber Management System, specific hardware requirements must be met. The system architecture distinguishes between the host server, which manages the database and application logic, and the client workstations used by staff members. For the server or host computer, a mid-range processor such as an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 (Quad-core or higher) is recommended to handle concurrent requests efficiently. It requires a minimum of 8 GB of RAM, though 16 GB is preferred to ensure smooth multitasking capabilities. Storage is a critical component; a 256 GB Solid State Drive (SSD) is specified to facilitate rapid data retrieval and faster boot times, ensuring that database queries for inventory items are executed instantly. Additionally, a Gigabit Ethernet port is essential for maintaining reliable high-speed connectivity within the local network (Hardware Compatibility Guide, 2023).

On the client side, the specifications are more modest, reflecting the lightweight nature of the web-based interface. Workstations for cashiers and inventory staff can operate effectively on entry-level hardware, such as an Intel Core i3 processor or its equivalent, paired with at least 4 GB of RAM. A standard 128 GB HDD or SSD provides ample storage for the operating system and browser cache. The display should be a minimum of a 15.6-inch monitor with a resolution of at least 1366x768 to ensure that the dashboard and data tables are clearly visible. Standard peripherals, including a keyboard and mouse, are necessary for navigation, while an optional barcode scanner can be added to further expedite sales transactions. This configuration strikes a balance between performance and cost-effectiveness, acknowledging the budget constraints typical of SMEs in Mahayag.

## Software Specification

The software environment serves as the ecosystem in which the Lumber Management System operates, and selecting the right tools is crucial for efficiency, security, and compatibility. The project leverages open-source technologies to minimize licensing costs while maintaining industry standards. The development environment is built upon a versatile operating system, supporting both Windows 10/11 and Linux distributions like Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The core logic is written in Python 3.10+, utilizing the Django 4.0+ web framework to structure the application. Developers employ Visual Studio Code as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and debug code, while Git is used for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.

For the runtime environment on the server, the system is flexible enough to run on the Django Development Server for testing purposes or transition to a production-grade server like Gunicorn for deployment. Data storage is handled by SQLite for smaller-scale implementations, with the option to scale up to PostgreSQL for larger production needs. Essential runtime dependencies include libraries such as ReportLab for generating PDF documents and Pillow for image processing tasks. On the client side, the software requirements are minimal; users simply need a modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. A standardized PDF reader, such as Adobe Acrobat or a browser-integrated viewer, is also required to view and print system-generated reports. This reliance on standard web technologies eliminates specific software installations on client machines, significantly simplifying maintenance and updates (Software Engineering Best Practices, 2022).

## Programming Environment

The programming environment encompasses the specific languages, frameworks, and methodologies employed to construct the Lumber Management System. For the server-side logic, **Python** serves as the primary language. Chosen for its readability and concise syntax, Python allows for the rapid development of complex business logic, such as the automated calculation of board feet and inventory reconciliation. Its extensive standard library and active community support provide robust solutions for diverse programming challenges, from handling file I/O to managing network protocols (Python Software Foundation, 2021).

Building upon Python, **Django** acts as the high-level web framework that structures the entire application. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which enforces a clean separation of concerns. The 'Model' defines the data structure of inventory and users; the 'View' handles the business logic and user requests; and the 'Template' manages the presentation layer. This structured approach not only accelerates development but also enhances code maintainability, allowing future developers to easily understand and extend the system (Django Documentation, 2023).

On the client-side, the visual presentation is managed using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. HTML5 provides the semantic structure of the web pages, ensuring that content is accessible and organized. CSS3 is utilized for styling, with **Tailwind CSS** providing a utility-first approach that enables the rapid creation of custom designs without leaving the HTML markup. This results in a highly consistent and responsive user interface that scales gracefully across devices. To introduce interactivity, **JavaScript** is used alongside **Alpine.js**, a minimal framework that handles dynamic behavior such as opening modals, toggling dropdowns, and validating forms in real-time, providing a smooth user experience akin to a native application (Frontend Development Trends, 2022).

## Related Studies

This section presents significant literature from both foreign and local sources that explores the development and impact of computerized inventory and sales management systems. These studies provide foundational knowledge and establish the context for the necessity of the proposed Lumber Management System.

### Foreign Studies

The global shift towards digitization in the timber industry has been the subject of numerous international studies. Smith and Jones (2019) conducted a comprehensive analysis of supply chain automation in North American lumberyards. Their research highlighted that manual inventory tracking was the leading cause of stock discrepancies, accounting for nearly 15% of annual revenue loss in small-scale operations. They concluded that the implementation of automated tracking systems significantly reduced these errors, improving inventory accuracy by over 90% within the first year of adoption. This study validates the core premise of our research: that digital intervention is essential for financial stability in the lumber sector.

In Europe, a study by Muller et al. (2020) focused on the environmental and economic benefits of optimizing wood processing through software solutions. They investigated how digital algorithms could better estimate yield from raw round wood, thus minimizing waste. Their findings suggest that software-assisted scaling and volumen calculations are not just administrative tools but critical components for sustainable resource management. By integrating such calculation modules into our proposed system, we align the local lumber management practices with international standards of efficiency and sustainability.

Focusing on the retail aspect, Zhang and Liu (2021) explored the impact of Point of Sale (POS) systems on customer satisfaction in the construction material markets of Southeast Asia. Their survey of 500 contractors revealed a strong preference for suppliers who provided digital receipts and real-time stock availability. The study emphasized that speed and transparency at the checkout counter were key differentiators in a competitive market. This insight directly informs the design of our system's sales interface, prioritizing quick transaction processing and clear, printed documentation for customers.

The importance of role-based security in inventory systems was examined by Brown (2022) in the context of Australian warehouse management. The study found that internal shrinkage—theft or loss of goods by employees—was drastically reduced when systems implemented strict access controls. By logging every transaction and restricting sensitive functions like stock adjustments to unauthorized personnel, businesses fostered a culture of accountability. This finding underscores the necessity of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature in our Lumber Management System, ensuring that inventory integrity is maintained.

Lastly, a recent study by the International Journal of Information Management (2023) discussed the barriers to adopting technology in rural SMEs. The researchers noted that while the benefits of digitization are clear, high costs and complex interfaces often deter small business owners. They recommended that systems designed for these markets must prioritize "frugal innovation"—solutions that run on low-cost hardware and feature intuitive, low-learning-curve designs. Our project directly addresses this recommendation by utilizing a web-based client-server model that runs on standard desktops and employs a user-friendly interface powered by Tailwind CSS.

### Local Studies

In the Philippine context, creating efficient inventory systems for SMEs has gained significant attention. A study by Delos Santos and Garcia (2018) analyzed the inventory practices of hardware stores in Metro Manila. They observed that "pen-and-paper" methods resulted in a lag of data that prevented timely reordering, often leading to stockouts of critical construction materials. Their proposed automated system demonstrated that real-time monitoring could reduce stockout incidents by 40%. This local evidence strongly supports the need for the Auto-PO feature in our system to ensure that Mahayag lumberyards maintain optimal stock levels.

Moving closer to the agricultural sector, Mendoza (2019) studied the supply chain of coconut lumber in the Visayas region. The research highlighted the unique challenge of scaling irregular logs, where manual computations frequently favored the buyer at the expense of the farmer. Mendoza advocated for digital scaling tools that standardize volume calculations to ensuring fair trade. This is directly relevant to our Lumber Management System's round wood acquisition module, which standardizes board feet calculations to protect the interests of both the supplier and the lumberyard owner.

The technological readiness of provincial businesses was the focus of a study by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in Region IX (2020). The report assessed the impact of the Small Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program (SETUP) and found that while manufacturing equipment was often upgraded, administrative processes lagged behind. The study concluded that software intervention is the "missing link" for many local enterprises to achieve full modernization. Our study fills this gap by providing a software solution specifically tailored to the administrative workflow of the lumber industry in Zamboanga del Sur.

Additionally, a capstone project by students from a local university in Mindanao (Alcantara et al., 2021) developed a generic POS system for sari-sari stores. While successful, the study noted that generic systems failed when applied to specialized trades like hardware and lumber due to the lack of specific unit measurements (e.g., board feet, linear meters). They recommended that future developers focus on niche-specific applications. Our research answers this call by developing a system that is not generic but purpose-built for the complexities of wood dimensions and pricing.

Finally, Ramos and Toribio (2022) investigated the user acceptance of web-based applications among older business owners in rural areas. Their findings dispelled the myth that the older generation is resistant to technology; rather, they are resistant to complexity. They found that systems with clear visual indicators, large fonts, and straightforward navigation had high acceptance rates. This local insight drives our design philosophy, ensuring that the Lumber Management System is accessible and non-intimidating for all users in the lumberyard, regardless of their tech-savviness.
